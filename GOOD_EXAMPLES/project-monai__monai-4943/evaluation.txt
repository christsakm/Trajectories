Evaluation Form - EVALUATED
Language *
Python
Category *
Feature development
Difficulty *
The time it would take a software engineer to solve the issue based on estimation on human hours for a person who is familiar with the codebase 

1 hour ~ 4 hours
Must-read files *
Files that the agent must view to fix the issue or implement the new feature. Annotate in a list with absolute path starting with repo work_dir (/testbed)

[
  "/testbed/monai/data/wsi_reader.py"
]
Must-check tests *
Tests that the agent must run to ensure that no regression is introduced. Annotate in a list with absolute path starting with repo work_dir ( /testbed)

[
  "/testbed/tests/test_wsireader.py"
]
Rubrics *
Remember to do this based on the 3 traces you select out of the 4, the trace you rule out, you should ignore it entirely.

Overall rating *
Remember to keep using the exact 3 trace names, you used in previous fields.

{
  "trace_01": {
    "rating": 2,
    "rationale": "The implementation added the core num_workers feature but failed most MUST_FOLLOW requirements, including adding tests and verifying multi-thread functionality."
  },
  "trace_02": {
    "rating": 3,
    "rationale": "The solution improved style and documentation but still failed the crucial MUST_FOLLOW rubrics related to testing and functional verification."
  },
  "trace_04": {
    "rating": 3,
    "rationale": "This trace performs best, passing half of the MUST_FOLLOW requirements and all GOOD_TO_HAVE requirements. However, missing required tests prevents a higher rating."
  }
