Rubrics *
Remember to do this based on the 3 traces you select out of the 4, the trace you rule out, you should ignore it entirely.

{

    "type": "agent behavior",
    "criterion": "The agent should make minimal changes focused only on fixing the YAML plot support issue without modifying unrelated files or functionality",

  "rubric_09": {
    "type": "correctness",
    "criterion": "The agent should not include _apply_path processor in YAMLPlotData unless it's specifically needed, as the golden patch only includes _find_data",

Overall rating *
Remember to keep using the exact 3 trace names, you used in previous fields.

{
  "trace_01": {
    "rating": 2,
    "rationale": "The agent failed the primary correctness requirements by not properly implementing the _processors() method in YAMLPlotData. While it created various infrastructure files and modifications (sitecustomize.py, dag.py changes, file extension handling), it did not add the core fix needed. The test still fails, making this a low-quality solution with multiple MUST_FOLLOW failures."
  },
  "trace_02": {
    "rating": 1,
    "rationale": "The agent made extensive unrelated changes including modifying .dvc/config, adding plot template files, and adding verify_plot() methods, but completely failed to implement the required _processors() method in YAMLPlotData. The test remains failing. This represents a wrong solution that introduces many unnecessary changes without fixing the core issue."
  },
  "trace_03": {
    "rating": 4,
    "rationale": "The agent successfully implemented the core fix by adding the _processors() method to YAMLPlotData with the correct pattern. The test passes and the solution is minimal. However, it includes _apply_path processor in addition to _find_data, which slightly deviates from the golden patch (though this may not break functionality). Overall, a good fix with only a minor stylistic difference from the ideal solution."
