Evaluation Form - EVALUATED
Language *
Python
Category *
Feature development
Difficulty *
The time it would take a software engineer to solve the issue based on estimation on human hours for a person who is familiar with the codebase 

1 hour ~ 4 hours
Must-read files *
Files that the agent must view to fix the issue or implement the new feature. Annotate in a list with absolute path starting with repo work_dir (/testbed)

[
  "/testbed/dvc/command/metrics.py",
  "/testbed/dvc/repo/metrics/show.py"
]
Must-check tests *
Tests that the agent must run to ensure that no regression is introduced. Annotate in a list with absolute path starting with repo work_dir ( /testbed)

[
  "/testbed/tests/test_metrics.py"
]
Rubrics *
Remember to do this based on the 3 traces you select out of the 4, the trace you rule out, you should ignore it entirely.

    "type": "correctness",
    "criterion": "The agent updates the metrics_show_parser in dvc/command/metrics.py to include automatic type detection in the help description.",

Rubrics rating *
After you select 3 traces out of the 4, ignore the one you ruled out entirely, but keep using the exact trace name.

{
  "trace_02": {
    "rubric_01": "FAIL",
    "rubric_02": "PASS",
    "rubric_03": "FAIL",
    "rubric_04": "PASS",
    "rubric_05": "FAIL",
    "rubric_06": "PASS",
    "rubric_07": "PASS"
  },
  "trace_03": {
    "rubric_01": "FAIL",
    "rubric_02": "PASS",
    "rubric_03": "FAIL",
    "rubric_04": "FAIL",
    "rubric_05": "FAIL",
    "rubric_06": "PASS",
    "rubric_07": "FAIL"
  },
  "trace_04": {

    "rubric_06": "PASS",
    "rubric_07": "PASS"
  }
}
Overall rating *
Remember to keep using the exact 3 trace names, you used in previous fields.

{
  "trace_02": {
    "rating": 3,
    "rationale": "Multiple MUST_FOLLOW correctness rubrics failed, indicating a low-quality solution with critical gaps. Although some GOOD_TO_HAVE items passed, they cannot compensate for the essential failures."
  },
  "trace_03": {
    "rating": 2,
    "rationale": "Only one MUST_FOLLOW rubric passed and several correctness issues remain unresolved. The solution shows partial effort but still falls below acceptable quality."
  },
  "trace_04": {
    "rating": 2,
    "rationale": "The majority of MUST_FOLLOW criteria failed. Despite some code-style successes, the solution does not satisfy core functional requirements and therefore warrants a low rating."
  }
