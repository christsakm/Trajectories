Evaluation Form - EVALUATED
Language *
Python
Category *
Feature development
Difficulty *
The time it would take a software engineer to solve the issue based on estimation on human hours for a person who is familiar with the codebase 

15 min ~ 1 hour
Must-read files *
Files that the agent must view to fix the issue or implement the new feature. Annotate in a list with absolute path starting with repo work_dir (/testbed)

[
  "/testbed/moto/scheduler/models.py"
]
Must-check tests *
Tests that the agent must run to ensure that no regression is introduced. Annotate in a list with absolute path starting with repo work_dir ( /testbed)

[
  "/testbed/tests/test_scheduler/test_scheduler.py"
]
Rubrics *
Remember to do this based on the 3 traces you select out of the 4, the trace you rule out, you should ignore it entirely.

{
  "rubric_01": {
    "type": "correctness",
    "criterion": "The agent adds 'CreationDate' and 'LastModificationDate' fields to the Schedule class in moto/scheduler/models.py.",
    "rationale": "Adding these fields is essential to match the expected response structure as per the boto3 documentation.",
    "importance": "MUST_FOLLOW",
    "is_positive": "true"
  },
  "rubric_02": {
    "type": "correctness",
    "criterion": "The agent updates the to_dict method in moto/scheduler/models.py to include 'CreationDate' and 'LastModificationDate'.",
    "rationale": "Ensuring these fields are part of the dictionary representation is crucial for correct API responses.",
    "importance": "MUST_FOLLOW",
    "is_positive": "true"
  },
  "rubric_03": {
    "type": "correctness",
    "criterion": "The agent modifies tests/test_scheduler/test_scheduler.py to assert the presence and type of 'CreationDate' and 'LastModificationDate'.",
    "rationale": "Tests must verify that the new fields are correctly implemented and returned.",
    "importance": "MUST_FOLLOW",
    "is_positive": "true"
  },
  "rubric_04": {
    "type": "correctness",
    "criterion": "The agent ensures that 'CreationDate' and 'LastModificationDate' are set to the current time upon schedule creation and update respectively.",
    "rationale": "Correctly setting these timestamps is necessary for accurate tracking of schedule creation and modification.",
    "importance": "MUST_FOLLOW",
    "is_positive": "true"
  },
  "rubric_05": {
    "type": "correctness",
    "criterion": "The agent does not introduce any syntax errors or regressions in moto/scheduler/models.py.",
    "rationale": "Maintaining code integrity is crucial for the stability of the library.",
    "importance": "MUST_FOLLOW",
    "is_positive": "true"
  },
  "rubric_06": {
    "type": "code style",
    "criterion": "The agent uses descriptive variable names for new fields in moto/scheduler/models.py.",
    "rationale": "Descriptive names improve code readability and maintainability.",
    "importance": "GOOD_TO_HAVE",
    "is_positive": "true"
  },
  "rubric_07": {
    "type": "agent behavior",
    "criterion": "The agent does not modify unrelated modules outside of moto/scheduler/ and tests/test_scheduler.py.",
    "rationale": "Limiting changes to relevant files prevents unintended side effects and keeps the focus on the task.",
    "importance": "MUST_FOLLOW",
    "is_positive": "false"
  }
}
Rubrics rating *
After you select 3 traces out of the 4, ignore the one you ruled out entirely, but keep using the exact trace name.

{
  "trace_01": {
    "rubric_01": "PASS",
    "rubric_02": "PASS",
    "rubric_03": "PASS",

    "rubric_05": "PASS",

Overall rating *
Remember to keep using the exact 3 trace names, you used in previous fields.

{
  "trace_01": {
    "rating": 5,
    "rationale": "All MUST_FOLLOW and GOOD_TO_HAVE rubrics were satisfied. The agent correctly added new fields, updated the model, extended the tests, preserved code integrity, and limited modifications to the required files."
  },
  "trace_03": {
    "rating": 5,
    "rationale": "The trace meets all rubric requirements, including correct field additions, timestamp handling, test updates, and contained changes. No regressions or style issues were introduced."
  },
  "trace_04": {
    "rating": 5,
    "rationale": "This trace fully satisfies all MUST_FOLLOW criteria and demonstrates additional validation through successful edge-case testing and confirming no existing tests were broken."
  }
