The time it would take a software engineer to solve the issue based on estimation on human hours for a person who is familiar with the codebase

15 min ~ 1 hour
Must-read files *
Files that the agent must view to fix the issue or implement the new feature. Annotate in a list with absolute path starting with repo work_dir (/testbed)

Rubrics *
Remember to do this based on the 3 traces you select out of the 4, the trace you rule out, you should ignore it entirely.

Rubrics rating *
After you select 3 traces out of the 4, ignore the one you ruled out entirely, but keep using the exact trace name.

Overall rating *
Remember to keep using the exact 3 trace names, you used in previous fields.

{
  "trace_01": {
    "rating": 2,
    "rationale": "Low quality fix that tokenizes block_lists instead of blocksize, causing the target test to pass but breaking deterministic naming tests. The agent did not add blocksize parameter to function signature or pass it from read_pandas, missing the core architectural fix. The wrong value was tokenized leading to 2 test regressions. Failed 5 MUST_FOLLOW rubrics."
  },
  "trace_02": {
    "rating": 2,
    "rationale": "Low quality fix that tokenizes blocks instead of blocksize, identical architectural issues to trace_01. The agent correctly identified the tokenize call as the fix location but chose to tokenize blocks rather than adding proper blocksize parameter flow. This causes test regressions because blocks vary even when blocksize is the same, breaking deterministic task naming. Failed 5 MUST_FOLLOW rubrics."
  },
  "trace_03": {
    "rating": 3,
    "rationale": "Partial fix with correct core logic - adds blocksize parameter and includes it in tokenize call matching golden patch approach. The agent correctly identified the root cause and implemented the proper solution in csv.py. However, despite correct changes, 2 deterministic name tests still failed as regressions, indicating something was incomplete or incorrect in the implementation. Failed 1 MUST_FOLLOW rubric."
  },
  "trace_04": {
    "rating": 5,
    "rationale": "Perfect implementation matching golden patch approach. The agent correctly identified the task name collision root cause, added blocksize parameter to text_blocks_to_pandas signature, passed it from read_pandas, and included it in tokenize. All tests pass including deterministic naming tests with no regressions. The solution is complete and correct. Zero MUST_FOLLOW failures."
