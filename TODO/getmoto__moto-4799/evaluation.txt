{
  "rubric_01": {
    "type": "correctness",
    "criterion": "The patch must detect inherited setUp methods by checking parent classes in the MRO (Method Resolution Order), not just the current class's direct methods",
    "rationale": "The core issue is that the decorator only checks direct_methods of the current class, missing setUp inherited from parent classes",
    "importance": "MUST_FOLLOW",
    "is_positive": "true"
  },
  "rubric_02": {
    "type": "correctness",
    "criterion": "The solution must exclude unittest.TestCase and object from the parent class check to avoid false positives",

    "is_positive": "true"
  },
  "rubric_05": {
    "type": "correctness",
    "criterion": "The solution must not modify the decorate_callable method's reset logic or add conditional reset behavior based on method attributes",
    "rationale": "Changing when/how reset happens breaks test isolation; the fix should be in has_setup_method detection only",

    "type": "code style",

    "type": "summary",
    "criterion": "The patch must modify only /testbed/moto/core/models.py and not introduce changes to unrelated files",

    "type": "agent behavior",

Overall rating *
{
  "trace_02": {
    "rating": 1,
    "rationale": "Fundamentally misunderstands the problem by modifying decorate_callable instead of fixing has_setup_method detection. The agent changes when reset happens (setting reset=False conditionally) rather than detecting inherited setUp from parent classes. This breaks test isolation, causing 6 PASS_TO_PASS test failures, and doesn't address the root cause that the decorator can't see setUp inherited from parent classes."
  },
  "trace_03": {
    "rating": 3,
    "rationale": "Correctly detects inherited setUp using inspect.getmro() and all tests pass (38 steps, 6 test runs). However, adds unnecessary complexity by dynamically decorating inherited setUp/tearDown methods with setattr logic, which is redundant since Python's inheritance already handles method resolution. Fails rubric_06 (no helper function extraction) and over-engineers the solution compared to the golden patch's simpler approach."
  },
  "trace_04": {
    "rating": 4,
    "rationale": "Successfully fixes the issue with a clean solution using inspect.getmro() to check parent classes and properly excludes unittest.TestCase. All tests pass with thorough verification (59 steps, 20 test runs). Demonstrates defensive programming with issubclass check. Fails rubric_06 (no helper function extraction) but otherwise matches the golden patch's logic closely."
